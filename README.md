<h2> Payslip (WinForms) </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>On the 10th of every month, my partner gets asked by many of her work-mates for help with their salary calculation, because they want to check  for fairness in pay. To help her out, I made this little program that takes the number of worked hours, overtime hours and the number of sick days (if any), and returns the calculated gross salary, tax, national insurance and pension contributions, and the net salary.</p>
<p>The user can change the the rates per hour for normal and overtime, the value of sick pay per day, pension contribution percentage and annual personal allowance. The value of these rates is keept in the application's settings and the changes will be remembered between runs.</p>
